# IA2 - Supervised Learning

## Introduction

This is the second Practical Assignment for the Artificial Intelligence course (IA) 2023/2024 @ **FEUP - Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto**. For this project, which description can be found [here](Description.pdf), we chose the [Banking Customer Churn Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/bank-customer-churn-prediction-dataset/data) (option C).

Our group is *Group_A2_44*, composed of:
- João Mendes Silva Belchior (up202108777@up.pt)
- José Francisco Reis Pedreiras Neves Veiga (up202108753@up.pt)
- Pedro Vidal Marcelino (up202108754@up.pt)

## Execution

This project was developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, along with some external libraries. To run this project, you must have Python installed on your machine. To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install notebook pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Then, just run the main notebook file inside the 'src' folder using Jupyter Notebook:
    
```bash
jupyter notebook src/main.ipynb
```
